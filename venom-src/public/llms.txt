# Semiautonomous Systems

> Research and analysis on AI training data enforcement, data poisoning defense, and the shift from preference signaling to technical countermeasures.

Semiautonomous Systems publishes the VENOM project: rigorous analysis of enforcement mechanisms in AI training data governance. We cover data poisoning, proof-of-work anti-scraping, robots.txt compliance, IETF AIPREF standards, and the legal landscape around unauthorized AI training.
